# Auto-Supports

Automatic support placement: given the island-analysis output for a model, decide where supports go, how thick they are, and brace them — then commit the whole thing as one undoable change.

Gated behind the `auto-supports` experiment (see [Experiments Framework](experiments-framework.md)); the gate is checked in `src/app/page.tsx`.

## The seam that matters: plan, then commit

`computeAutoSupportPlan(islands, modelId, settingsOverride?, baseState?, baseKickstand?, mesh?)` is pure with respect to the stores: it clones the current snapshots, works on drafts, and returns an `AutoSupportPlan` holding `before`, `kickstandBefore`, the new `support` and `kickstand` states, and analytics. It commits nothing.

`runAutoPlace(...)` is the thin caller that computes a plan and, only if `result.changed`, calls `setSnapshot()` / `setKickstandSnapshot()`.

Keep that split. It is what makes the run testable without a store, lets a caller preview or discard a run, and keeps the whole placement — including auto-bracing — a single history entry rather than a stream of mutations.

## The pipeline

Six phases inside `computeAutoSupportPlan` (`autoPlace.ts`):

| # | Phase | What happens |
| - | ----- | ------------ |
| 0 | Settings | Normalize; bail out returning `null` when disabled |
| 1 | Generate candidates | Turn detected islands into `CandidatePoint`s |
| 2 | Deduplicate | Collapse candidates that would support the same spot |
| 3 | Place | The bulk of the work — fixed-density ring + grid infill distribution, trunk/leaf decisions, collision checks, gap filling |
| 4 | Forest resize | Re-derive every trunk's stepwise diameter now that the forest is known |
| 5 | Auto-bracing | Braces computed into the same draft, so they ride the one commit |

## Candidates

Islands arrive from volume analysis carrying a `source`. Three matter: `overhang` (the mesh-normal classifier's shallow surfaces), `minima` (local low points, only when `class === 'minimaOnly'`), and `intersection`.

Priority is a weighted score — **60% area, 30% Z height** (lower is more urgent, it prints first), **10% source bonus** for intersections, further boosted when `prioritizeIntersection` is on.

## Distribution: one fixed-density scheme

There is no anchor selection, no bake-off, and no grid/Poisson split. Every
overhang region above `gridAreaThresholdMm2` gets the same treatment in
`generateGridCandidates` (`gridPlacement.ts`):

- **Boundary ring** — the region's perimeter resampled at fixed spacing in the
  2D-projected plane (`sampleBoundary2D`). Projection is the point: Z does
  not lengthen a boundary, so a sliver's ring is a short line and can never
  climb a limb. Each sample's Z comes from the surface sampler.
- **Grid infill** — a lattice over the footprint bbox at `computeRegionSpacing`
  (angle + suction curve), skipped for slivers (nothing survives footprint
  erosion). The lattice spans the region with integer rows/columns, inset by
  the contact radius.
- **Shape handles degenerate cases**: below the threshold → the region's
  single-candidate path (one pillar); sliver → ring only; normal face → ring +
  infill. `MAX_GRID_CANDIDATES_PER_REGION` (800) caps each region, falling
  back to angle-only spacing and even subsampling — never silently denser.

Surface resolution is triangle-accurate: `createTriangleSurfaceAt` upward-raycasts
the model mesh and accepts only hits whose face index is in the region's
`triangleIds` (exact barycentric Z); `createVoxelSurfaceAt` (0.25 mm mask +
lazily-built hash) is the fallback when no mesh or triangle list exists.

Deleted with the old scheme (do not reintroduce without a run-level reason):
anchor bands/column tests (`anchorBands.ts`), the competitive bake-off
(`distributionBakeoff.ts`), the Poisson disk generator and flatness dispatch
(`poissonPlacement.ts`), per-region anchor spacing multipliers, Z-banded
anchor density, and the anchor girth multiplier. Density is one knob:
`areaPerSupportMm2`, modulated by angle and suction.

## Coverage and gap filling

A tip covers surface within `TIP_COVERAGE_RADIUS_MM` (3 mm). A region needs no gap filling once `REGION_COVERAGE_TARGET` (95%) is met; uncovered clusters below `MIN_GAP_CLUSTER_MM2` (2 mm²) are not worth filling, and there are at most `MAX_GAP_FILL_PASSES` (3) passes per run.

## Sizing is empirical, not physics

!!! warning "Physics-based sizing was tried and removed — do not reintroduce it"
    An area-derived shaft curve **inverted the profiles**: a light 16 mm² cell sized *thicker* (1.28 mm) than a heavy 5 mm² cell (1.12 mm), because the curve rose with cell area. Light / Medium / Heavy are now hardcoded profile blocks (detail ≈ 0.8, structure ≈ 1.0, anchor ≈ 1.2 shafts) and sizing follows the active block. Session overrides apply until the next profile switch. See the header comment in `parameterSizing.ts`.

Tip contact is the profile band scaled by underside angle — flat ceilings get the full contact, steeper slopes less — floored at 30% of the shaft so a thick shaft keeps a proportional tip. Roots, tip length and penetration take the profile band flat.

## Rules worth knowing before you change placement

- **Overhang pillars consolidate into chunk trees.** After placement, neighbouring ring/infill/standalone trunks fan into each other (radius 8 mm, capacity `maxAttachmentsPerTrunk`) — supports release in chunks with one plate contact per chunk. The consolidation angle is relaxed to **75° from vertical** (vs 60° for placement fans): on a surface sloped <30° from horizontal, neighbouring pillars can never satisfy 60° (the link angle is always 90° − surface slope), so chunking would be geometrically impossible. The chunk's interior hosts carry the load; shallow links are connective tissue. Same-height pillars (vertical drop < 0.4 mm) never straight-fan; when the straight leaf is blocked, crosses, or the surface is too flat AND the tip sits at ≥ `CONSOLIDATION_BRANCH_MIN_HEIGHT_MM` (10 mm), a **routed branch** attaches it to a host shaft instead — high above the plate that reads as a tree; near the plate it is suppressed (it would read as a zig-zag web). Near-plate contacts (tip Z < `ANCHOR_HEIGHT_THRESHOLD_MM`, 5 mm) place as [anchor](../reference/support-anatomy/anchor.md) primitives and stay standalone.
- **Grid trunks are fanning hosts only up close.** `GRID_HOST_FAN_RADIUS_MM` (2.5 mm) is deliberately tighter than the general `LEAF_FAN_RADIUS_MM` (5 mm), so fan leaves do not sweep across the grid forest and puncture its shafts.
- **Fanning attaches to segments, not trunks.** `collectFanShaftPoints` samples per-segment (`segmentId` + `t`) and `fanLeafToTrunk`/`buildConsolidationBranch` create knots with `parentShaftId: segmentId, t` — not `trunkId`. Legacy `trunkId` knots are rehosted to the nearest segment before `computeForestDiameterProfile` so diameter demands include fan leaves and drift checks use segment geometry. `countAttachmentsOnTrunk` handles both for backward compat.
- **Orphan validation after resize.** After `computeForestDiameterProfile` the pipeline rehosts legacy knots and runs `validateAndCullOrphans` (drift >0.5 mm, missing host/segment culled; `cross`/`blocked` reported but kept). Culled leaves/branches and their orphan knots are removed, `ForestReport.orphans[]` lists `id/kind/reason/hostId/knotId/detail`, and `forestReportToText` emits `ORPHANS CULLED`. This is where the "leaf attached to nowhere" (drifted knot after a host trunk’s diameter split) is caught — check the report before the render.
- **A candidate within `ALREADY_SUPPORTED_RADIUS_MM` (3 mm) of an existing tip is already supported** and is skipped.
- **Gridless runs still merge**: candidates within `GRIDLESS_MERGE_RADIUS_MM` (4 mm) of an existing trunk join it.
- Every shared radius and span lives in `autoSupport/constants.ts`, which exists because these previously had inconsistent copies in `autoPlace.ts` and `gridPlacement.ts`. Add new ones there.
## Settings and reporting

`settings.ts` declares roughly twenty knobs with `AUTO_SUPPORT_CONSTRAINTS` giving each a min/max/step/default — including two debug switches (`debugSupportOriginColors`, `debugSkipAutoBracing`, the latter for faster iteration). Use `normalizeAutoSupportSettings` / `applyAutoSupportSettingsPatch` rather than building the object by hand.

A run returns `AutoPlaceAnalytics` and a `ForestReport`; `forestReportToText` renders it for the placement summary. The report is the primary debugging surface — every decision includes a *why*.

### Report sections

`ForestReport` lives in `src/supports/autoSupport/types.ts` (`ForestReport`, `ForestScanMetrics`, `OrphanInfo`, `ForestTree`). `forestReportToText` in `src/supports/autoSupport/autoPlace.ts` is the copy-paste renderer.

- **SCAN** — `209 islands (voxel …) → 187 candidates · 1 overhang` plus `coverage 100% of 438mm²`. Coverage is the  footprint fraction @3mm.
- **ORPHANS CULLED** — grouped by `reason` with counts and human-readable help, then per-entity `id (kind) reason @host knot … — detail`:
  - `trunkBlocked` — shaft pierces mesh (would print through model, SDF `distance < radius` on `isShaftBlocked`)
  - `blocked` — `knot→tip` ray hits mesh (`leafConeCollides` offset ray, tip-0.5mm, not straight segment; `branchCollidesWithSDF` for branches)
  - `missingHost`/`missingSegment`/`missingKnot` — knot points to segment/trunk that has no joints or was culled (legacy `trunkId` before `segmentId+t` rehost)
  - `drift` — knot >0.5mm from host shaft (split offset, `pointToSegmentDistanceSq >0.25`)
  - `cross` — leaf/branch crosses another shaft after thickening (`leafPathCrossesSupports` `radius 0.25`, kept but flagged)
  - `host trunk culled (blocked)` — leaf on a trunk that was itself `trunkBlocked`
- **PLACEMENT DIAGNOSTICS** — `Trunks by kind: grid 44 (ring + infill), gap-fill 0, standalone 41 (sub-threshold overhang, no host)`; `Candidates by source: voxel 49 · minima 21 · intersection 47 · overhang 98`; `Fan refusals: noHost=1 (too far >5mm/2.5mm grid, angle >60°, sameZ|cross|blocked|capacity)`; `Merge refusals: noHost=22, rejected=20`; `Consolidation refusals: blocked=99, cross=3 (sameZ=surface too flat for side-leaves — chunking needs ≥0.4 mm neighbour height rise)`. Sourced from `diagnostics` captured in `computeAutoSupportPlan`.
- **Counts** — `56 trunks · 70 leaves … | 16 trees, 40 bare` — `trees` are hosts with members, `bare` are 1:1 pillars.
- **FAN-OUT GROUPS** — `v115 @ Z=26.6mm Ø1.03mm [area 0.53mm² …] → 12: v116(L 2.8mm/20°) …` with header `(host trunk → leaves/branches within 5mm fan radius, 2.5mm for grid hosts, <60° from vertical, not blocked/crossing, not at capacity)`. `spanMm`/`angleDeg` are `knot→tip` distance and angle from vertical.
- **STANDALONE TRUNKS** — `grid-o0-… @ Z=5.1mm Ø1.21mm [area 10mm² …]` plus `— region ring + grid infill` or `— standalone voxel/minima (below threshold or consolidated)` based on `id` prefix.

**Orphan reporting:** post-resize `rehostLegacyKnots` + `validateAndCullOrphans` cull `drift`/`missingHost`/`missingSegment` (orphan knot >0.5 mm off its host segment) and report `cross`/`blocked` without culling. `ForestReport.orphans[]` (`OrphanInfo`) and `forestReportToText` `ORPHANS CULLED` surface them. Drift is the "leaf attached to nowhere" case — host segment split rehost failed or knot was placed on a trunk that later split.

**Diagnostics reporting:** `ForestReport.diagnostics` captures `diagnostics.candidatesBySource`, `trunksByKind`, `fanRefusals`, `mergeRefusals`, and `consolidationRefusals` so the text report can explain *why* a candidate became a trunk/leaf/standalone vs fanned/merged — and why a region did not chunk (`sameZ` = surface too flat for side-leaves).
